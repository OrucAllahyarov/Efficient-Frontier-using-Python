# Efficient-Frontier-using-Python
This project is a practical implementation of Modern Portfolio Theory, focusing on the concept of the Efficient Frontier. The aim is to explore different asset combinations and identify portfolios that provide the best possible return for a given level of risk.

Using real market data, the code calculates portfolio returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios, and visualizes portfolios that lie on the Efficient Frontier. Key portfolios such as the minimum volatility portfolio and the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio are highlighted to clearly show the risk–return trade-off.

What Does This Project Do?

Fetches historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance

Calculates daily returns, expected returns, and the covariance matrix

Uses SciPy optimization to find:

Minimum volatility portfolio

Maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio

Portfolios along the Efficient Frontier

Visualizes results using Matplotlib and Plotly

Why This Project?

Portfolio optimization concepts can feel abstract when only explained theoretically. This project focuses on turning those ideas into clear, working Python code using real market data. It is intended for anyone interested in quantitative finance, portfolio management, or applying Python to financial analysis.

Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Pandas

SciPy

Matplotlib

Plotly

yfinance
