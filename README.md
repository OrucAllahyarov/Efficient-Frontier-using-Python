# Efficient-Frontier-using-Python
This project implements Modern Portfolio Theory using the Efficient Frontier approach. It uses real market data to calculate portfolio returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios, and applies optimization techniques to identify minimum volatility and maximum Sharpe portfolios, visualizing the risk–return trade-off in Python.
